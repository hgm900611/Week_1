<p>It mainly focuses on the Dynamic TCP Acknowledgement issue aimed at minimizing the acknowledgement cost and presents a randomized online algorithm which achieves the competitive ratio <code>e/(e-1)</code>. It turns out that this ratio is completely the same as the 'ski-rental' problem. It's an amazing result and there must be some relationship between this two problems although they seems to be quite different. The authors then open this door by constructing a burst input for the TCP acknowledgement issue. So wonderful, for this special input, these two problems have exactly the same expression form in terms of competitive ratio. Finally, this paper translates this randomized algorithm to solve the Bahncard problem and gains the same competitive ratio for the <code>\beta = 0</code> case.  </p>

<p>The greatest contribution this paper makes is that it generalizes the 'ski-rental' problem and proposes a clear paradigm for solving such problems. </p>

<p>The biggest trick this paper plays is the algorithm <code>Az</code>. Actually, understanding this <code>Az</code> well is quite important for getting through the whole work. The main idea behind <code>Az</code> is that we can saving z amount of latency cost if we adding one more acknowledgement some time earlier. Same thing for the 'ski-rental' problem, if we buy the ski earlier, we should save z dollars. </p>
