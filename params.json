It turns out that this ratio is completely the same as the 'ski-rental' problem. It's an amazing result and there must be some relationship between this two problems although they seems to be quite different. The authors then open this door by constructing a burst input for the TCP acknowledgement issue. So wonderful, for this special input, these two problems have exactly the same expression form in terms of competitive ratio. Finally, this paper translates this randomized algorithm to solve the Bahncard problem and gains the same competitive ratio for the `\\beta = 0` case.  \r\n\r\nThe greatest contribution this paper makes is that it generalizes the 'ski-rental' problem and proposes a clear paradigm for solving such problems. \r\n\r\n## Some comments\r\nThe biggest trick this paper plays is the algorithm `Az`. Actually, understanding this `Az` well is quite important for getting through the whole work. The main idea behind `Az` is that we can saving z amount of latency cost if we adding one more acknowledgement some time earlier. Hence, it's trivial to show `A1` is 2-competitive. Same thing for the 'ski-rental' problem, if we buy the ski earlier, we should save z dollars. Whatever the traffic input is, it can hurt one `Az` for a particular z most. Thus, we can adopt the randomized algorithm to achieve a better result. I think it's better if the author can explain more intuition on the algorithm `Az`.\r\n\r\nThe proof to bound the competitive ratio for each `Az` is also nontrivial, it's based on the comparison between the optimal online solution even though this solution is unknown.
