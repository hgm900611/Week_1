{"name":"Paper Read Summary in Week 1","tagline":"","body":"# Dynamic TCP Acknowledgement and Other Stories about e/(e-1)\r\n***\r\nThis paper leaves me a very good impression in the sense that the proposed algorithm and mathematical analysis is pretty beautiful. \r\n\r\nIt mainly focuses on the Dynamic TCP Acknowledgement issue aimed at minimizing the acknowledgement cost and presents a randomized online algorithm which achieves the competitive ratio `e/(e-1)`. It turns out that this ratio is completely the same as the 'ski-rental' problem. It's an amazing result and there must be some relationship between this two problems although they seems to be quite different. The authors then open this door by constructing a burst input for the TCP acknowledgement issue. So wonderful, for this special input, these two problems have exactly the same expression form in terms of competitive ratio. Finally, this paper translates this randomized algorithm to solve the Bahncard problem and gains the same competitive ratio for the `\\beta = 0` case.  \r\n\r\nThe greatest contribution this paper makes is that it generalize the 'ski-rental' problem and proposes a clear paradigm for solving such problems.
